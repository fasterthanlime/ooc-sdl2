## ooc-sdl

SDL 2.0 bindings for ooc. SDL is a thin layer to handle windowing, basic
pixel operations, and event handling in a cross-platform manner.

It has various extensions for image loading, sound mixing, font loading,
networking, etc.

SDL 2.0 improves on SDL 1.2 by adding support for multiple windows, fully
hardware accelerated rendering, and improved input capabilities.

These bindings are fairly incomplete, currently only sdl2/Core and sdl2/Event
have been updated, and may still be missing some types and functions. Please
contribute!
